## Ideas:
| Model            | Difficulty | Concept Type                 | Main Learning Outcome             |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 2D XY Model      | ★★         | Statistical Mechanics        | Phase coherence, BKT transition   |
| Ginzburg–Landau  | ★★★★       | Field Theory / PDE           | Order parameter, vortices         |
| Josephson Array  | ★★         | Classical nonlinear dynamics | Josephson current, oscillations   |
| BCS / BdG        | ★★★★       | Quantum Hamiltonians         | Energy gap formation              |
| Kitaev Chain     | ★★★        | Quantum topology             | Majorana modes, topological phase |
| London Equations | ★★         | Classical electrodynamics    | Meissner effect                   |
| Vortex Pinning   | ★★         | Classical particle dynamics  | Type-II vortex behavior           |

I think Kitaev would be cool because it's topological, and if not then Josephson or 2D XY Model would be good. With 2D XY I could maybe reuse either code or knowledge from monte carlo from my REU

1. Write a `README.md` file for your project, and commit it to the repository. The README should contain the following information:
    
    - The title of the project.
    - A 1-2 sentence description of the project. What is the problem you are solving, and what is the main idea of your solution?
    - A list of the planned directory structure of the project. For example, many projects might use a top-level `demo.ipynb` file that shows a minimal example of the project working, and then call a subdirectory `src/project_name.py` that contains the main code implementation. Some projects might have a `data` directory that contains the data files needed to run the project, or a `results` directory that contains the results of the project. What you include here entirely up to you and your project, the goal here is to make sure you have a plan for the project’s components and structure and how to break them apart into manageable pieces.
    - 2-5 bullet points describing the planned chronological steps to complete the project, including the main code you plan to write, what other implementations are available if you plan to build on top of them, and what other components you plan to add.
    - A 1-2 sentence description of the planned contributions of each team member.
    - Any additional notes, references, or information that you think is relevant to the project and necessary for someone else to understand your project.
    - You can change all of this later, the README at this stage is so that the course staff can understand your project and give you feedback on your plan, if needed.

Title:

Description:


Bullet points:
- Want to try to do simulations related to modern lab so we can make a connection from simulation and experiment
- Investigate 4 different topics of interested related to superconductivity and determine which ones we want to incorporate into the project. Once we figure out the main topics, do research to find sources and learn about the topics more in depth and what kind of simulations we can do.


Notes:
- Can we just recreate something that exists or do we want to have to probe something new? How can we expand upon them

- Be very explicit with documentation.
